I wated to make a little skate shop/photography page.
Hunny dip is My friends brand in where we try to psuh skateboarding and the use of videography and photgraphy

HTML and CSS used to complete this project 

had fun being creative with the web and the structure

struggled with timing and remembering the order of things.
 also its hard to differentiate with way i should go when wanting to include boxes,divs, and images and how yo seperate them.

 next time will plan better and try not to let personal matters delay my working process
 cant wait to create more
